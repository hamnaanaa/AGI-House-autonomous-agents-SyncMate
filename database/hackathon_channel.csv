Harrison Chase,"sorry i posted in the wrong channel!

Excited to see what gets built today! As mentioned, we'll be giving access to LangSmith (<https://smith.langchain.com/>) to all participants. Use access code `langsmith_hackathon_agi` and ill be around all afternoon (currently in the foyer at the front) to answer any questions",2023-07-22 15:46:11

Jack,"I have been working on a <https://github.com/jackmpcollins/magentic|Python package >`magentic` that makes using openai function calling as easy as writing python function signatures. My goal today is to have one project use this (it could be yours!). As Harrison said earlier OpenAI function calling and custom prompts are the best tools to use for your hackathon project, and `magentic` is built to enable exactly that! <https://github.com/jackmpcollins/magentic>",2023-07-22 15:02:25

Div Garg,"<!channel> Instructions for using the *MultiOn API*:
• Please come to the desks near the presentation area for signing our Hackathon Participation form &amp; getting any support
• You can directly use MultiOn from *Langchain*: <https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/agents/toolkits/multion>
• You can also check our API examples and also build custom agents directly using our *python &amp; js sdk*s : <https://github.com/MULTI-ON/api>
• Here's an example agent built with MultiOn API to scrape information online &amp; send back a screenshot: <https://github.com/MULTI-ON/api/blob/main/examples/Multion_api_example.ipynb>
• You can find *documentation* &amp; installation instructions for MultiOn here: <https://docs.multion.ai/>
• Finally we are building a *Skills Marketplace* for MultiOn and please reach out to us if you want to help build it :star-struck:",2023-07-22 14:18:42
Jackson Jesionowski,"Been working on creating a strong multi-action-agent.

A week ago I watched a friend copying prompts and using GPT to answer questions for an accelerator, said he planned to apply to every accelerator and incubator and pre-seed firm, had a link list of 1,200 different.

I thought that had to have been automated already, but came up with nothing. Thus working on a complete AutoFormFiller today, working on optimizing it, sample demo below. DM me to join up / help.

We first evaluate if the data file uploaded will provide a good answer, and when it doesn't have the data, it prompts user entry, and saves the response for future responses",2023-07-22 14:01:24
Jackson Jesionowski,"Also quick idea for anyone searching, that I plan to explore in the future, I've used applications like UbotStudio and Zennoposter which are no-code browser automation tools, they include multi-threading, headless browsing, captcha breaking. Would love to see an LLM agent built on top of those platforms. Seems it would take the multi-action-agent space much further by building on top of these systems.",2023-07-22 14:00:07
